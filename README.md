custeam, but more

so you heard of https://custeam.io/? Similar, only it runs locally. 
Goals: 
* all the storage you can supply, as opposed to like 1000 chars (which is admittedly very fair for free)
* don't have to log in
* doesn't have to ask steam what game you're playing
  * watch the foreground for what you're playing (the way logitech's stuff does... or did, they seem to be getting away from that)
  * accept some signal somehow (which you can fire off from logitech's stuff, for example, if you want)
* scriptable in some way. Might like to load steam screenshots, since steam's own overlay doesn't seem to be ready for you to view an image at its own size. 
* more versatile (complicated) than just a big text field and some links that aren't allowed to be local (if I could just log in to google keep from the steam browser this whole thing would probably be obsolete)
  * checkboxes
  * sub-items
